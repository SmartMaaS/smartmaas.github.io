General Bikeshare Feed Specification, abbreviated as GBFS, provides a standardized data feed for bike share system. [GBFS](https://github.com/amohoste/gbfs-linked) makes real-time data feeds in a uniform format publicly available online, with an emphasis on findability. [GBFS](https://github.com/amohoste/gbfs-linked) is intended to make information publicly available online; therefore information that is personally identifiable is not currently and will not become part of the core specification.

We provide a free and ready-to-use data processing system which transforms and publishes [GBFS](https://github.com/amohoste/gbfs-linked) archives into [Linked Data](https://github.com/amohoste/gbfs-linked) using Linked GBFS and [Linked Connections](https://linkedconnections.org/) vocabularies.
